    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>We are Kessoku Band, as mentioned in the welcome page! Our band consists of four members: Kita Ikuyo (that's me writing!) on vocals and rhythm guitar, Hitori Gotoh on lead guitar, Ryo Yamada on bass, and Nijika Ijichi on drums! We are passionate in our goal of performing rock music that is powerful and meaningful for everyone to enjoy and have performed in many places around Tokyo, like the Zepp Haneda! We hope to one day perform at the Nippon Budokan! Now, please enjoy the memorable group photos we've taken!
